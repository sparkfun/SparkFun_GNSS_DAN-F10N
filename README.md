The SparkFun DAN-F10N Dualband GNSS Breakout is built around the powerful u-blox F10 engine, offering simultaneous reception of L1 and L5 frequency bands. This board leverages u-blox's advanced multipath mitigation technology to isolate the strongest signals, delivering reliable, meter-level position accuracy even in dense urban canyons. To ensure signal integrity, the module incorporates a robust SAW-LNA-SAW RF front-end with an additional notch filter (LTE B13), providing excellent rejection of interference from nearby cellular modems.

This breakout features a compact, integrated 20mm x 20mm x 8mm Right-Hand Circular Polarized (RHCP) dual-band patch antenna, offering a great balance of size and performance. Its wide beamwidth allows for flexible device orientation. For even greater utility, an onboard switch will enable you to easily connect an external dual-band antenna.

The DAN-F10N is fully supported by the u-blox u-center-2 software for configuration, data logging, and real-time performance analysis. It is also compatible with AssistNow (Online, Offline, and Autonomous) A-GNSS services for significantly faster satellite acquisition. You can interface with the module using the standard NMEA 4.11 and UBX binary protocols.

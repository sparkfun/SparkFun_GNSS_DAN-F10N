The SparkFun DAN-F10N Dualband GNSS Breakout is built around the powerful u-blox F10 engine, offering simultaneous reception of L1 and L5 frequency bands. This board leverages u-blox's advanced multipath mitigation technology to isolate the strongest signals, delivering reliable, meter-level position accuracy even in dense urban canyons. To ensure signal integrity, the module incorporates a robust SAW-LNA-SAW RF front-end with an additional notch filter (LTE B13), providing excellent rejection of interference from nearby cellular modems.

The SparkFun Dualband L1/L5 GNSS Breakout - DAN-F10N features u-blox's dual-band GNSS technology for the L1/L5 frequency bands. Their proprietary dual-band multipath mitigation technology enables the u-blox F10 GNSS engine to isolate the best signals from the L1 and L5 bands; delivering a solid meter-level position accuracy in challenging urban environments. Additionally, the DAN-F10N module's robust SAW-LNA-SAW RF architecture with an additional notch filter (LTE B13) on the L1 RF path ensures the best possible out-of-band interference mitigation from nearby cellular modems.

The DAN-F10N GNSS module on this board comes with a 20 x 20 x 8 mm, integrated, Right Hand Circular Polarized (RHCP), L1/L5 dual-band patch antenna that offers the best compromise between size and performance. The patch antenna's wide beamwidth provides flexibility in the device's orientation; while alternatively, the module also has an antenna switch function to give users the option to utilize an external dual-band antenna, further increasing its utility.

The DAN-F10N module is supported by the u-blox u-center 2 GNSS software for real-time performance analysis, receiver configuration, and data logging. The AssistNow Online, Offline, and Autonomous A-GNSS services can also be used with the module for faster satellite acquisition. Users can also interface with the GNSS module using NMEA 4.11 and UBX binary protocols.


> [!NOTE]
> The GPS `L5` signals are currently, considered as *"pre-operational"* and not utilized by default in navigation solutions. However, it is possible override the receiver's configuration to evaluate the GPS `L5` signals. Please refer to the integration manual for more details.
> 
> This is an operational limitation of the satellite/space segment and not an issue of the u-blox product.
